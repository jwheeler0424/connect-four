            <h3>Description of the Game</h3>
            <p>Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. Click on the preferred column and the pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.</p>
            <p>The game is played with 2 players on the same screen. We will consider that the player who is logged into the game will be the first player. The second player will be played by another person on the same machine, same screen.</p>
            <p>At the end of the game, we will only record the information from Player 1. At the end of each game, the score, the duration of the game, and the number of turns will be saved in the RDBMS on the server side, so they can be displayed in the leaderboard page. The server side will be only used to save the results of each game, keep information about Player 1.</p>
